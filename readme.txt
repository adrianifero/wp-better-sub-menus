== Description ==

WP Better Sub Menus improves the menu admin screen (nav-menus.php) by allowing you to Expand/Contract the menu items.  Specially useful when your menu consist of a few dozens of items.

Other features include:

- Sticky sidebar for easier access to the links sidebar menu
- Scrollable sidebar.
- Colored menu items to indicate if a menu item has subitems inside
- Easy click & expand or click & contract.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your blog, activate it and go to Appearance / Menus. You'll see that now your menus are nested and contracted.  Note: If you don't have any submenus or nested menus, you'll not going to notice any changes.

This plugin introduces only visual changes, your navigation functionality remains the same.
